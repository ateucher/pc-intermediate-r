## Project-oriented workflows

- Concept of a project <!-- (vs `setwd("it/works/on/my/machine")`) -->
- Project structure
- Embrace the blank slate <!-- Restart often (vs `rm(list = ls())`) -->
- RStudio and/or Positron settings
- Naming things
- File organization

## Personal R administration

- Where do packages live?
- Installing and updating packages
- R Startup
- `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron` files

## Efficient use of your IDE
- Customizing your IDE
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Tab completion
- Getting help: Reprexes
