title: "System Setup ðŸ¤–"
---

You will require the following software installed and configured for the workshop.
Please have this set up and ready to go **before** we start.

## Computing requirements

You will need:

-   A laptop computer with administrative privileges
-   [R and RStudio](#install-r-and-rstudio)
-   [R package development toolchain](#install-r-package-development-tools)
-   [Several R packages](#packages)
-   [Git](#git)
-   [GitHub account](#github)

## Install R and RStudio {#install-r-and-rstudio}

You will need:

-   R version \>= 4.4.0
-   RStudio \>= 2024.04 or Positron \>= 2025.09.0-139

### Install R

Download and install R for your operating system from <https://cloud.r-project.org/>.

### Install R Studio

Download and install RStudio Desktop from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.
This page should automatically offer you the version suitable for your operating system, but you can scroll down to find versions for all operating systems.

### Install Positron

Download and install Positron from <https://positron.posit.co/download.html>.
This page should automatically offer you the version suitable for your operating system, but you can scroll down to find versions for all operating systems.

## Install R package development tools {#install-r-package-development-tools}

#### For Windows

Download and run the latest **Rtools** installer, `Rtools.exe`, from <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>.

-   Keep the default settings for the installation location and components to install
-   check the box to add rtools to the system PATH.

#### For Mac

Install **XCode**.
The easiest way is to open a Terminal window (Applications \> Utilities \> Terminal.app; or use the Terminal pane in RStudio) and type the following:

```
xcode-select --install
```

You will be prompted to confirm the install, and possibly enter your computer password.
Do so to complete the installation.

Alternatively you can:

1.  Download and install XCode from the Mac AppStore: <http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12>
2.  Within XCode go to Preferences : Downloads and install the Command Line Tools

#### For Linux

If you installed `r-base-dev` when installing R, you should have all you need to build packages from source.
If not, go back to <https://cloud.r-project.org/> and follow the instructions for your distribution (Ubuntu and Debian are likely the most common, and install it with `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev`).

## Git

We will be learning the use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

### Windows

Check if Git is installed by running `which git` in the **Terminal** pane in RStudio.

If `which git` didn't find Git installed:

-   Download and install from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
-   Keep all the default settings. If asked about "Adjusting your PATH environment", make sure to select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software".

#### RStudio + Git

-   Open RStudio. In the menus go to Tools \> Global Options \> Git/SVN.
-   Check RStudio has found git under "Git executable". If it hasn't:
    -   You may need to click Browse and find the git executable.
    -   It may be in `C:/Users/[username]/AppData/Local/Programs/Git/`

#### Positron + Git

- Positron is smart about finding git, but if it doesn't find it automatically:
-   In the menu go to File \> Preferences \> Settings.
-   Search for "Git Path".
    -   Click "Edit in settings.json" and add the path to the git executable.
    -   It may be in `C:/Users/[username]/AppData/Local/Programs/Git/cmd/git.exe`

### Mac

Check if Git is installed by running `which git` in the Terminal.
You should see something like `/usr/bin/git`, `/usr/local/bin/`, or `/opt/homebrew/bin/git`.

If you are asked to install the Xcode command line tools, say yes.

If `which git` didn't find Git installed, and if you weren't prompted to install it, run the following in the **Terminal**: `xcode-select --install`

::: aside
If you do lots of scientific computing and especially if you use command-line programs in the Terminal, we recommend using Homebrew.
See [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) for installation instructions.
To install Git using Homebrew, run the following in the Terminal: `brew install git`

## GitHub {#github}

Register a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/).

I highly recommend the book [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) for advice on setting up and using Git with R [@bryan].

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with the setup please start a discussion on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ateucher/pc-intermediate-r/discussions).
